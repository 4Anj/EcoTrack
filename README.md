# ðŸŒ± EcoTrack: Personal Carbon Footprint Tracker

EcoTrack is a beginner-friendly Python project that helps users calculate and track their monthly carbon footprint based on their daily habits. It also uses data visualization and machine learning to analyze and classify environmental impact. 

> ðŸ’¡ Built as part of my learning journey in Python and Data Science â€” this is my first complete end-to-end project, from logic to ML!

## What It Does

 **User Input & Calculation**  
It asks the user for inputs on:
- Daily travel distance
- Monthly electricity usage
- Weekly meat consumption
- Monthly online orders  

These are used to calculate an estimated **monthly COâ‚‚ emission (in kg)**.

 **Visual Insights**
- Monthly average carbon footprint
- Emission increases or decreases over time

 **Machine Learning**
- A Decision Tree Classifier that labels the user as:
  - **Low**
  - **Medium**
  - **High**
  carbon emitter based on their input.
  
 **Suggestions Engine**  
After classification, the program gives small actionable advice to lower emissions.
